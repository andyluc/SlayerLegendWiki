## OVERVIEW
Hello! Welcome to the Slayer Legend guide created by me (Andy). This guide is designed to break down how to progress efficiently in the game as a F2P player or a light spender (definitely not 🐳 status). While there are surely extreme min-max strategies out there, everything here comes from my own experience with characters on both Server 1 and Server 2. I’ve been playing Slayer Legend for about three years now, so I’d like to think I have a solid grasp of how things work. So without further ado, let’s dive into progression!
