# GitHub Issue Backups

This directory contains monthly backups of all open GitHub issues.

## Backup Strategy

- **Daily**: Uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts (90-day retention)
- **Monthly**: Committed to this directory (1st day of each month)

## Backup Contents

Each backup includes ALL open issues:
- User-generated data (skill-builds, battle-loadouts, spirit-builds, achievements)
- System cache issues (highscore-cache, user-snapshot, achievement-stats)
- Comment system issues (wiki-comments)
- All other open issues

Each issue includes:
- Issue metadata (number, title, body, labels, state, user, dates)
- All comments (body, user, dates)

## Restoration

To restore issues from a backup:

1. Parse the JSON file
2. For each issue, create a new issue with original metadata preserved in body
3. For each comment, create comments on the new issue
4. **Note**: Restored issues will have new numbers (original numbers preserved in body)

### Manual Restoration Process

```bash
# Example using GitHub CLI
cat issues-backup-2025-12-28.json | jq -r '.issues[] | "\(.number) \(.title)"'

# For each issue:
gh issue create --title "Restored: <original title>" --body "<original body + metadata>"
```
