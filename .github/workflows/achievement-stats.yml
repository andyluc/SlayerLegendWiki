name: Update Achievement Statistics

# This workflow calculates and updates achievement statistics (% of users with each achievement)
# whenever a user snapshot is updated. Statistics are stored in a cache issue for fast retrieval.
#
# The workflow:
# 1. Fetches all user snapshots to count total users
# 2. Fetches all achievement issues to count unlocks per achievement
# 3. Calculates percentage for each achievement
# 4. Stores results in a cache issue labeled "achievement-stats"
#
# Triggers:
# - When achievement issues are created/updated (labeled 'achievements')
# - Manually via GitHub UI (Actions tab)
