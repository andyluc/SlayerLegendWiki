name: Backup GitHub Issues

# This workflow creates comprehensive backups of all open GitHub issues
# including user data, system cache, and wiki comments.
#
# Backup Strategy:
# - Daily: Upload as GitHub Actions artifact (90-day retention)
# - Monthly: Commit to repository at backups/issues/ (1st day of month only)
#
# Backup Contents:
# - All open issues (user-generated data, system cache, comments)
# - All comments for each issue
# - Issue metadata (labels, user, dates)
#
# Schedule: Runs daily at 2 AM UTC (consistent with other scheduled workflows)
# Manual: Can be triggered manually via GitHub UI (Actions tab)

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC
